# 🧪 Parabank Manual Testing Project

This repository contains the documentation, test cases, and bug reports for a manual software testing project conducted on the [Parabank](https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm) demo banking application. The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world manual testing practices through a structured and traceable process.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The objective of this study is to manually test the core functionalities of the Parabank web application, covering both **positive** and **negative** scenarios. Through this process, we aimed to simulate a real QA workflow, from writing test cases to executing them, identifying bugs, and reporting them.

## 🧾 Scope of Testing

The following key features of the application were tested:

- User Registration  
- User Authentication (Login)  
- Account Overview  
- Open New Account  
- Transfer Funds  
- Request Loan  
- Update Contact Info  
- Bill Payment  
- Find Transactions  
- Logout Functionality

Each of these modules was tested with both valid and invalid input values to evaluate the robustness, input validation, and session handling of the application.
